GitHub Project for Module 05 assignment

This is my initial edit to my readme file. 

I want to create a project that will do the following:
1.  End all wars,
2.  Solve issues of world famine,
3.  Play awesome music.

We should also focus on:

4.  Curing Cancer
6.  Ending World Poverty
8.  Stabilizing Climate Change
9.  And if we can...
    * A legal, free streaming service that had every movie and t.v. show known to man

*Thanks for attending my TED talk.*
